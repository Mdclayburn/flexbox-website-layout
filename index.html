                <p> I was born and raised in Colorful Colorado. I love everything about my state. 
                    Especially the variety of scenery from Downtown Denver to the Rocky Mountains and
                    then to the small "beaches" and huge lakes! I believe we've got it all.

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p> There is just SO much for me to explore in Colorado alone it could take a lifetime to see it all. 
                    I also love how we experience all four seasons. I love the snow but they say Colorado has had more sunny days 
                    than the sunshine state itself!(Florida) Can you believe it?!

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p> I'm sure everyone can say something good about the state they were born in but I don't think another state 
                    is as awesome as mine! Well, maybe everyone says that too. Either way I am greateful for where I was born and 
                    I cannot wait to explore and fall in love with every bit of it.
